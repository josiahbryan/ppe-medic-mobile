## Description
There is an urgent need to plan for and distribute PPE to all health workers, especially frontline community health workers, especially in countries with the weakest health systems. We need the best possible projections of supply needs for CHWs to best serve their communities while also protecting themselves.

We used Partners In Health model estimating that one set of Personal Protective Equipment (mask, shield, gloves, gown) costs about $10.
